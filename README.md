# üå± Pretrained Latent Diffusion Models for Plant Leaf Augmentation

We propose **pretrained models of Latent Diffusion** trained from scratch for mango leaf disease images.  
These models can be used to **augment any other plant leaf datasets** by generating synthetic but realistic images.  
Researchers and readers can fine-tune these pretrained models for their own datasets and generate new images.

üìÇ Pretrained Model Files
Our pretrained model consists of:
- encoder.pth  
- decoder.pth  
- unet.pth  

All trained up to 1000 epochs on mango leaf disease dataset.

How to Use

1Ô∏è‚É£ Setup Environment

git clone https://github.com/pankajgithup2025-cmd/PreTrainedLeafDiffusion.git
cd PreTrainedLeafDiffusion

# (Optional) create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac

# install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

import torch

# Example: loading pretrained components
encoder = torch.load("encoder.pth", map_location="cpu")
decoder = torch.load("decoder.pth", map_location="cpu")
unet    = torch.load("unet.pth", map_location="cpu")
3Ô∏è‚É£ Fine-tuning on Your Dataset
Prepare your own plant leaf dataset (RGB images, recommended size 512√ó512).
Use the pretrained models as initialization:
Encoder + Decoder for latent space transformation
U-Net for diffusion learning
Train for fewer epochs (e.g., 100‚Äì200) since base model is already trained.
# pseudo-code
train(model=unet, data=my_leaf_dataset, epochs=200, lr=1e-5)

4Ô∏è‚É£ Generate New Images
After fine-tuning, you can sample synthetic images:
# pseudo-code for generation
images = diffusion_sampling(encoder, decoder, unet, num_samples=50)
save_images(images, "augmented/")


Applications

1.Data augmentation for plant disease classification
2.Extending limited datasets into large-scale datasets
3.Benchmarking generative models in agriculture
